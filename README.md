# Unity Video Game: Cedar Hollow 🌱🐝

## About the Project
This is a side project built in Unity, created by a small student team (3 of us).  
Even though I’m not a gamer myself, I saw this as a fun way to **hone my coding and creative skills** while contributing to something meaningful.

- 🎮 **Game Concept**: A mystery-driven, beekeeping RPG where raising bees helps save the climate and protect a town in peril.  
- 💻 **Tech**: Learned **C#** to develop gameplay mechanics.  
- 🎨 **Art**: Contributing original artwork alongside programming.  
- 🤝 **Teamwork**: Joined fellow students to design and build the game together.  

Our mission is to **entertain while educating** players about climate responsibility, sustainable growth, and caring for the community.

## Story & Gameplay
You play as a teen sent to live with your beekeeper grandfather in a coastal town.  
When he mysteriously disappears, you must care for his bees, help townsfolk with real-world struggles, and uncover the larger mystery behind Cedar Hollow.  

Choices you make impact:
- 🌳 The environment (nurturing vs. polluting)  
- 👫 Relationships with townsfolk  
- 🐝 The survival of your bees and forest  

The game is structured in **15 chapters across 3 acts**, with each chapter centered on helping a town member and uncovering more of the mystery.
